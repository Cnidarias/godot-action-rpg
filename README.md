# godot-action-rpg

This is an action RPG that is created with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and its base is a one to one copy from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ&list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a&ab_channel=HeartBeast) tutorial series which I can highly recommend.

## Next Plans

1. Create additional Monsters
2. Create NPCs with quests
3. Create some kind of Quest System
4. Implement Money Count
5. Add random encounters
